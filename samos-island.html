												<h2>Samos Island</h2>
												<p>Samos is a Greek island in the eastern Aegean Sea, south of Chios, 
												north of Patmos and the Dodecanese archipelago, and off the coast of western Turkey, 
												from which it is separated by the 1.6-kilometre-wide (1.0 mi) Mycale Strait. 
												It is also a separate regional unit of the North Aegean region.</p>

											<h3>Ancient times</h3>
											<p>In ancient times, Samos was an especially rich and powerful city-state, particularly 
											known for its vineyards and wine production. It is home to Pythagoreion and the Heraion of Samos, 
											a UNESCO World Heritage Site that includes the Eupalinian aqueduct, a marvel of ancient engineering. 
											Samos is the birthplace of the Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, after whom the 
											Pythagorean theorem is named, the philosophers Melissus of Samos and Epicurus, and the astronomer 
											Aristarchus of Samos, the first known individual to propose that the Earth revolves around the Sun. 
											Samian wine was well known in antiquity and is still produced on the island.

											The island was governed by the semi-autonomous Principality of Samos under Ottoman suzerainty from 
											1835 until it joined Greece in March 1913.</p>
							
											<h3>Climate</h3>
											<p>Samos has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate, with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers. 
											The highest temperature ever recorded is 43.0 °C (109.4 °F) while the lowest is −3.4 °C (25.9 °F). 
											July is the hottest and driest month followed by August while February is the coldest month and 
											December records the highest amount of precipitation. Samos receives about 705 millimetres (27.8 in) 
											of rainfall annually while the average annual temperature is 18.4 °C (65.1 °F). Humidity is lowest 
											during the summer and highest at the end of autumn.</p>
